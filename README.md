embd = embedded (pronounced Emm Bee Dee)

Like koaning/bulk but with built in functionality provided by Quaternion for similarity model finetuning

POC. Lightweight UI for interactive labelling similarity tuning of NLP models (maybe image eventually). None of this code exists yet. Hopefully will get it done in the next few weeks. 

UI, probably just Streamlit, may try javascript.

Any old-fashioned data storage in SQLite.
